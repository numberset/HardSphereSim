HardSphereSim
=============

Event driven simulation of hard spheres in python. A bunch of particles are constraint into a 2d unit cube and can only collide which eath other and the walls. Each particle is considered to be a hard sphere with a certain radius. 

The simulation is event driven and only advances the time to the next impending collission.
